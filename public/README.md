1. **jen-saries-2.webp** - Professional photo of Jen Saries for the homepage hero section
2. **aapd-mini-conference-2.webp** - Image for the AAPD Marriage Mini-Conference event card

Please add these image files to this directory. If the original files are not available, you can use placeholder images with the same filenames until the actual images are ready.

## Adding Images

Simply place the .webp files in this directory:
- `/public/jen-saries-2.webp`
- `/public/aapd-mini-conference-2.webp`

The website will automatically display them once they're added.
